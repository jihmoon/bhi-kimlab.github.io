생물 정보 & 생명 정보 연구실에 오신것을 환영합니다.

B&H 연구실은 algorithm, machine learning(컴퓨터 전공 관련 프로젝트) 부터 human cancer, bacterial genome comparative analysis, enzyme sequence analysis, signal transduction pathway analysis (생물 전공 관련 프로젝트) 까지 다양한 분야의 연구를 하고 있습니다.

Recent advances in instrumental technologies allow us measure data at intra- and inter-cellular levels  in terms of various biological and disease phenotypes. This exciting, unprecedented opportunities  come with novel challenges for biological and health informatics research. 

Our lab addresses these challenges by developing novel computational/data mining infrastructure, and machine learning and algorithmic techniques. The goal is to help accelerate development of new scientific and industrial paradigms including personalized medicine and healthcare.
